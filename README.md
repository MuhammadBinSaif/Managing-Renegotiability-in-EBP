# Managing-Renegotiability-in-Blockchain-based-Enforceable-Business-Processes
Blockchain technology has been proposed in recent years as an enabling technology for supporting the execution of inter-organizational business processes, due to its inherent capability of automatically enforcing activities and mitigating the lack of trust through its immutability. At the same time, this inherent immutability typically clashes with the need to update process specifications, particularly in the presence of changes in the relationships among organizations or in the case of changes in the contextual environment. For this reason, the concept of \ebpEx (\ebp) has been proposed in the literature as an evolution of the original concept of smart contract, which is capable of automating potentially incomplete, renegotiable, and procedural contracts. 
This paper proposes a comprehensive solution for managing renegotiability in \ebp, which is based on the proxy mechanism but also includes the ability to migrate running instances from the current implementation to the new one, thanks to the use of shared storage, as well as the option to have running instances executing different implementation versions through a router mechanism. These two characteristics together represent a substantial improvement over currently available solutions, which typically allow only one uniform running version at a time and where updates are possible only when no running instances are present.
